# Acquire the Data

We are going to use the twitter to get all the beats1play. This may sound counter-intuitive but it seems like the easiest way. Courtesy [Beats1Plays](https://twitter.com/Beats1Plays) twitter account which seems to run off a ruby script developed by [callumj on github](https://github.com/callumj/beats1). 

Lets use twitteR to get all the tweets from @Beats1Plays account. Now the Twitter APi has a limit of 3200 latest tweets from any user account. See more details at this link -  https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline

This could potentially be an issue - so lets do a back of the envelope calculation to see how many days of plays will be there in 3200 tweets. At 3.5 to 4 mins per song play, we should have about ~ 400 songs per day (24 * 60 / 3.5 ). So with 3200 tweets is equal to nearly 8 days of plays. So even if we run the script once every week we should be fine.

```{r}
# Getting started with TwitteR
library(twitteR)
library(httr)
library(stringr)
  
setup_twitter_oauth(getOption("consumerKey"), 
                    getOption("consumerSecret"), 
                    getOption("accessToken"), 
                    getOption("accessTokenSecret"))

# Get the user timeline for all the songs played
tweets <- userTimeline("Beats1Plays", n = 3200,
                      includeRts = FALSE, excludeReplies = TRUE)

# Apply method to change the tweets into data frame
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14678172/converting-twitter-results-to-data-frame
tweets.df <- do.call("rbind", lapply(tweets, as.data.frame))

# Get the last tweet time, convert it to dashes format and save to file
maxtime <- as.character(max(tweets.df$created))
maxtime <- str_replace_all(maxtime,"[ :]", "-")
file <- paste0("data/tweetsdb-",maxtime,".csv")
write.csv(tweets.df, file = file)
```
