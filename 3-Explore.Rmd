Lets start exploring the data and see if we can see some trends, patterns and even exception.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

plays <- read.csv("data/tweets_processed.csv")

# Top Plays by artist
plays.top <- plays %>%
              group_by(artist) %>%
              summarize(count = n()) %>%
              arrange(desc(count))
plays.top
```
