Lets start exploring the data and see if we can see some trends, patterns and even exceptions.

```{r}
# Load the data and libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

plays <- read.csv("data/tweets_processed.csv")
plays$created <- ymd_hms(plays$created)
```

Top 10 plays by artist
```{r}
# Top Plays by artist
plays.top.artist <- plays %>%
                    group_by(artist) %>%
                    summarize(count = n()) %>%
                    arrange(desc(count))
plays.top.artist
```

Top plays by song
```{r}
# Top Plays by song & artist
plays.top.song  <- plays %>%
                   group_by(song.artist) %>%
                   summarize(song.count = n()) %>%
                   ungroup() %>%
                   arrange(desc(song.count))
plays.top.song
```

Lets plot this and start to see...

```{r}
ggplot(plays.top.song) + aes(song.count) + geom_histogram()
              
plays.top.song.time <- inner_join(plays, plays.top.song[1:20,],
                                  by = "song.artist")

ggplot(plays.top.song.time) + aes(x = created, y = song.artist) +
    geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.75) + 
    scale_x_datetime()

```
